## Features:
- üìê 3D Scatterplot Rendering: Prototype includes depth, color, and size to represent multiple dimensions of data.
- üïπÔ∏è Basic Interaction: View and navigate scatterplots in AR to explore data spatially.
- üåç Meta Spark Integration: Leverages the power of Meta Spark AR Studio to create engaging and accessible AR experiences.
- ‚ö° Dataset Compatibility &  Flexibility: Tested with small datasets for prototyping and experimentation.
## Goals
- Serve as a starting point for future development in AR-based analytics tools.
- To experiment with AR visualization potential and explore the capabilities of Meta Spark AR for advanced data visualization.
- Evaluate the feasibility of AR-based scatterplot interaction.
## Requirements:
- Meta Spark AR Studio
- Compatible device for testing AR experiences.
